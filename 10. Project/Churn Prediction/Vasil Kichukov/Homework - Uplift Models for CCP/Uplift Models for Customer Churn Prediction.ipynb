    "The stage for a comprehensive investigation into the effectiveness of customer churn uplift models (CCP) compared to predictive models, specifically in the context of a financial institution. It addresses the gap in empirical evidence in the literature and emphasizes the need for an appropriate evaluation framework aligning with business objectives. Prescriptive analytics, particularly uplift modeling, is introduced as a potential paradigm shift in improving predictive analytics. The emphasis on the practical application in customer retention efforts adds relevance. The introduction successfully highlights the research objectives, the novel contribution of the __Maximum Profit Uplift (MPU)__ measure, and the importance of evaluating models in a profit-driven context. Overall, it effectively orients the reader toward the study's purpose and significance."

The use of a dataset from a financial institution, including relevant details, enhances transparency. The rationale behind selecting _Logistic Regression_ and _Random Forests_ as modeling techniques is well-founded, considering their applicability and performance in predictive and uplift modeling. The application of _Random Stratified Sampling_, the distinction between training sets for CCP and CCU models, and the adoption of the Maximum Profit Uplift (MPU) measure add methodological rigor."

The use of a dataset from a financial institution adds real-world relevance to the study. The division into Scenario 1 and Scenario 2, each evaluated with distinct measures (MP/MPU), demonstrates a systematic approach to comparing the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The visual representation of profit curves for logistic regression and random forests in both scenarios enhances the clarity of results. The authors appropriately address the challenge of parameter uncertainty by conducting experiments with multiple sets of cost and benefit parameters, showcasing robustness. The decision to use logistic regression and random forests is justified, considering their prevalence and adaptability.\n",

    "The analysis of results is insightful, especially in highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of CCP and CCU models. The emphasis on the novel MPU measure provides a valuable contribution to the evaluation of uplift models. However, it would be beneficial to elaborate further on the rationale behind choosing the specific parameters for the MPU measure.\n",

The authors aptly address the potential impact of parameter variations on the results, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the model evaluation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparison between Scenario 1 and Scenario 2, particularly in terms of the MP and MPU measures, adds depth to the analysis. The authors' clear articulation of the observed dominance of CCP models in Scenario 1 and the superior performance of CCU models in Scenario 2 contributes to the robustness of the study. The discussion on churn rates, uplift, Qini curves, and similarity in ranking provides a comprehensive view of model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inclusion of visual aids, such as figures and tables, enhances the interpretability of results. The Qini curves and lift curves effectively communicate the incremental gains and model performance at different cutoffs. The stability analysis across five repetitions strengthens the reliability of the reported results.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the findings are well-supported, further exploration of the implications of the observed differences in rankings and overlaps between models would add depth to the discussion. Additionally, a more detailed exploration of the stability analysis results could be beneficial.\n",
